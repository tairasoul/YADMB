4. Add this Redirect URI : `http://127.0.0.1/index.html` or any url according to you. [ Also note this somewhere ]

5. Now create a `authorize.js` file and add this code :
    ```ts
    const play = require('play-dl');
    
    play.authorization();
    ``` 
    and run it `node authorize.js`

6. You will be asked :-
     - Saving INFO in file or not. [ If selected no, you will have to use `setToken` function after you get refresh-Token ]
     - Client ID
     - Client Secret
     - Redirect URI or Redirect URL
     - Market [ Choose 2 letter code on left side of your country name from [url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) ]
     - You will be given a link for authorizing. Just paste it in your browser and click on authorize and copy the link that you are redirected to. [ Redirected Link should start with Redirect URI / Redirect URL that you have provided ]
     - Paste the url in Redirected URL

7. You have completed Authorization part. Now you can delete authorize js file. 

You will notice that a folder named `.data` has been created. **Do not delete this**, this contains all your spotify data. [ Only applicable if save in file is set to yes. ]
