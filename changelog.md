# Changelog for YADMB

Add an addon framework.

This makes it possible to add custom commands or resolvers for audio, name, song and playlist.

This also means you no longer have to rely on me to add support for something, and can instead just make your own addon for it.

Rename repo to YADMB, for Yet Another Discord Music Bot.
